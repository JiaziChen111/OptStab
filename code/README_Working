I suppose first I should update the calibration if I am going to do that.

The goal is to add a robustness case on wage cyclicality, which means changing zeta_2.  Ultimately, I will create a new OS_Version_X.py

First, I should verify that I can reproduce the main result.
1) in OptStab, change version to 1   √
2) run ./submit2q according to README_SCC  √
3) Download SearchResults_v1.npz and WelfareGrid_v1.npz
4) cd code/global
5) jupyter notebook OptStab_Plot.ipynb
6) Cell -> run all

It all runs, but the results are slightly different from what we have in the paper.



How much do I adjust zeta_2?

Brainstorm:
- * {0.5 , 2}
- intensive margin hours account for 2/3 of variation in total hours
- reg log w on log y, get coeff.  then adjust zeta to get * {0.5, 2}
